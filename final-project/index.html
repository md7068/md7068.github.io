				<p>Congratulations you are Cheddar Cheese! Your personality suggests that you are the most widely purchased and eaten personality type in the world! You have a natural personality, but you slightly crumble under pressure. Although, in the right situations you can be quite smooth.  Especially in your younger days. The more you mature, the sharper you get. You tend to wear yellow and orange clothes, which is just too bright for most people.  Maybe it&#39s time to look at a few Macy&#39s catalogues and broaden your wardrobe horizon.  You should be ashamed of yourself.</p>

				<h3>Jeff Bridges</h3>
				<p><img src="images/Jeff_bridges.jpg"></p>
				<p>Our survey indicates that your cheese type is Jeff Bridges. We love your beard in this picture, and your eyes always leave us wondering just what you are thinking. We really loved your performance in the remake of 'True Grit'. You were a gunslinging cowboy in that movie, and while you were a reliable shot, you had a bad temper, and this can be very off-putting for people that don't know the reliable trusting person that you really are.  Our suggestion, open up a little bit more, and maybe people will want to socialize with you.  You should still be ashamed of yourself. </p>
